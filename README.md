# LambdaTest


# Step 1: Create .gitpod.yml
The .gitpod.yml contains everything that describes the dev environment as code. Most importantly it contains a list of commands that should be executed when a dev environment is prebuilt and when it is started.

# Step 2: Change Base Image
The .gitpod.yml optionally references a Docker image or a Docker file, which is used as the container for the dev environment. This is where installation of all the tools (such as runtimes, compilers, databases, etc.) that is needed during development is added. The assistant can propose a couple of default Docker images which are based on the Dockerfiles maintained here.

# Step 3: Update Readme
Add a badge to your README.md to tell your team or community about the automated dev environments.
